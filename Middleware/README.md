what is middleware ?

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

There are three type of middleWare:

   1. built in
   2. custom
   3.third party

use() is used to define middleware that executes on every request, regardless of the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). Path Pattern Matching: app. use() can be used to define middleware that runs only for specific URL paths. If no path is specified, it applies to all routes.
